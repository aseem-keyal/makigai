# sheru
A minimalist anki alternative written in posix shell. No dependencies (besides GNU core utils or macOS builtin utils), no database, no media, only front/back cards supported. Uses a tab-separated file as its "database." Currently using the SuperMemo-2 algorithm. Designed to be portable and run on any POSIX compliant shell with echo, date, awk, shuf, and read installed.
